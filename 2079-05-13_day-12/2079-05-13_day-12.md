INHERITANCE
===========

1. ### Maintainability:
    1. no small change affect the whole program. it means code should be maintainable.
2. Example
    ```
    class Vehicle
    {
        // setting default value N/A- not available
        public string VNumber {get; set;} = "N/A";
        public float Mileage {get; set;}
        public double load;
        
        public void Print()
        {
            var vehicleInfo = $"Plate : {VNumber} \nMieage : {Mialeage} \nLoad Capacity : {load} tons";
            Cosnole.WriteLine(vehicleInfo);
            
        }
    }
    ```

3. Each and every data type has its own default value for example for int its zero
4. it some data stores null value compiler throws null exception we can avoid it from .proj file or
5. value = null!; -called null forgiving cmd
6. arrow notation for parent child arrow is always showing parrent.


### INTERFACE
=============

** note : name space is a virtual container i.e. we dont need to put it in same folder we can put it anywhere **
