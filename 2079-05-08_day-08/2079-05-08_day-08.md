MORE ON LOOP
============

### while is in-loop and for loop is out-loop
* **Read Use Cases Of All Loops**

##### WHILE AND DO-WHILE

#### FOREACH
* ex byte[] ages = {12, 23, 45, 56, 78, 90, 32, 43, 54, 65};
* for(int i =0; i < ages.Length;i++){
    Console.Write(ages[i]+" ");
    }
* USING FOREACH
* foreach(byte age in ages){
    Console.Write(ages+" ");
}
* when we want to find positions of an item in an array we must use for loop

#### escape sequence
* \n \t \r \b  etc are use called escape sequences

* @-verbating character and $- is called string interpolation.

#### string interpolation
* it is generally used to put variables in string.
* string fullName = $"Hello {variable}";

#### verbatium interpolation
* it is generally used for storing directories in string
* it removes escape sequences.
* string fullName =  @"c:\desktop\";


### NESTED LOOP
===============
* we use nested loops to iterate through multi-dimentional array.
*
