# Day-04
    1. Single line comment //this is singleline comment and multiline comment /* this is multiline comment */
    1. Squiggle error, warning, and info
    1. int.Parse() method to convert string to integer
    1. To stop program excecution ctrl+c
    1. Strongly typed languages are those which has pre information about its type but in weekly typed language no information is known like javascript, python we can declare all variables using let var in js or without any type in python but in language like java or c# there should be type included. like int a;
    1. Different DataTypes in CSharp
        1. we can make any type nullable by using ? in the prefix of type like int? a = 2; or string? name = null;
        1. Numbers
            1. Byte
                1. Assignemnt- byte a = 12; range 0-255 in binary 00000000 to 11111111
            1. Short
                1. It has two types signed and unsigned
                1. Assignment- byte a = 12000; range from -32,768 to 32,767
                1. unsigned range 0 to 65,535 Unsigned 16-bit integer
            1. Int
                1. Declaration : int a = 45435;
                1. Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647	Signed 32-bit integer
                1. uint	0 to 4,294,967,295	Unsigned 32-bit integer
            1. Float
                1. assignment- float = 45.0; // Precision
                1. Precision- accuracy
                1. any floating number is by default double
                1. to tell this is a floating point number we should assign f in the last of the number like
                45.4546545646546456f;
                1. Range-            
            1. Double

                1. verbatium character @"string \D\";
                1. interpolation $"string{variable}";
                1. Range
